# SemiFlow (TODO)

SemiFlow is a neural network framework for machine learning.

I am going to implement a neural network framework in a about month. :)

> SemiFlow是一个从零(严格来说是numpy)开始的神经网络框架的。我已经使用Tensorflow和keras好些年，
并且最近完成了"Statistical machine learning", "Artificial intelligence","Natural computation 
for machine learning"。我对自己动手实现深度学习框架很感兴趣。SemiFlow就是用来练手的。
