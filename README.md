# SemiFlow (TODO)
SemiFlow is a neural network framework for machine learning.

I am going to implement a neural network framework in a about month. :)
In the first week, 

- [x] forward propagation
- [x] backward propagation
- [x] gradient based method
- [x] ReLU
- [x] Sigmoid
- [ ] Tensor support
- [ ] Train MNIST

In the second week

- [ ] Auto differentiate
- [ ] computational graph

In the third week

- [ ] Convolutional neural network
- [ ] Pooling layer
- [ ] Stochastic gradient descent

In the fourth week

- [ ] CUDA support

In the fifth week

- [ ] Examples and other docs
